### Introduction

`Dining philosophers problem` is a classical one in CS and
in concurrent algorithm design in particular. It states as following:

> Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

</p>

> Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can
> only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can
> be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only
> if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual
> philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the
> forks become available to others. A philosopher can only take the fork on
> their right or the one on their left as they become available and they cannot
> start eating before getting both forks.

> Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space;
> an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

> The problem is how to **design a concurrent
> algorithm such that no philosopher will starve**; i.e., each can forever
> continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no
> philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

**Today we are going to speak in terms of philosophers-threads and forks-mutexes.**

### Problem statement

The general rules are the same as above except these:
* number of philosophers is parameterized
* philosopher eats and sleeps for a constant amount of time passed as program parameters
* philosopher falls asleep as soon as they finished eating
* `time_to_die` is time philosopher can survive with no food. Time is counted 
 from last eating **begin** time. (e.g. is if `time_to_eat = 100`
 and `time_to_die = 50` the philosopher dies during eating, also they can die
 in their sleep with parameters `time_to_die = 150`, `time_to_eat = 100`,
 `time_to_sleep = 100`)
* the programme should work as a simulation
* philosopher dies â‡’ simulation stops
