### Introduction

`Dining philosophers problem` is a classical one in CS and
in concurrent algorithm design in particular. It states as following:

> Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

</p>

> Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can
> only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can
> be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only
> if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual
> philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the
> forks become available to others. A philosopher can only take the fork on
> their right or the one on their left as they become available and they cannot
> start eating before getting both forks.

> Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space;
> an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

> The problem is how to **design a concurrent
> algorithm such that no philosopher will starve**; i.e., each can forever
> continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no
> philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

**Today we are going to speak in terms of philosophers-threads and forks-mutexes.**

### Problem statement

The general rules are the same as above except these:
* number of philosophers is parameterized
* philosopher eats and sleeps for a constant amount of time passed as program parameters
* philosopher falls asleep as soon as they finished eating
* `time_to_die` is time philosopher can survive with no food. Time is counted 
 from last eating **begin** time. (e.g. is if `time_to_eat = 100`
 and `time_to_die = 50` the philosopher dies during eating, also they can die
 in their sleep with parameters `time_to_die = 150`, `time_to_eat = 100`,
 `time_to_sleep = 100`)
* the programme should work as a simulation
* philosopher dies â‡’ simulation stops
* some limitations on using libc function

Check the original task [here](https://projects.intra.42.fr/projects/42cursus-philosophers).

### Purposes 
There are two main points of complexity in comparison with original problem:
1. the philosopher can eat and sleep not as long as they wants and must do everything in time
2. the philosopher can die due to inappropriate input (not because of deadlock)


According to the facts above and unwillingness to rely on inaccurate 
`usleep` to sync philosophers' actions (it was supposed by the task, btw)
I had to use some tricks

### Solution

#### General overview
One fork -- one mutex, one thread. 


#### Deadlock safety
Let the forks be numbered in circle `1, 2, ..., n`. To avoid deadlock each 
philosopher should respect the rules:
* the first fork to take is a fork with a **smaller number**
* put down a fork in a **reverse** order (i.e. **bigger** fork first)

#### Time sync

#### Stopping the simulation

### Proof of correctness

### Implemetation

### Usage
```zsh 
make
# ./philo num_of_ph time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
# Last parameter is optional, can be used to limit the simulation time
./philo 5 400 200 200
```
